      <h1>Project Idea</h1>

        <h4>Overview</h4>
          <div class="project">
            Parking at shopping centres especially during peak days and hours, can be
            such a rageful and time-consuming thing. Although some shopping centres have
            indicators to let you know the availability of the car parks, you can only
            see the availability of them once you are down the road from them. Therefore,
            for my project idea, I want to develop an app open for Apple users, to assist
            them whilst they are trying to find park at shopping centres. Further it will
            assist them in finding their car when returning to their vehicle after leaving
            the centre.
          </div>

          <h4>Motivation</h4>

        <div class="project">
          Chadstone has large number of car parks already available for everyone that
          are coming in, however the centre still experiences an excessive amount of
          traffic and issues within their car parks. Many reasons being that people are
          unable to find a free, available cark park, and that people are struggling to
          find their vehicle after they leave the centre. Which is seen through Emel49
          which they say that “the problem is finding your car again!” and that individuals
          will end up “wandering around for hours”. Additionally, Holidaydreamer states
          “parking is a problem at Chaddy,”. Therefore, it is essentially for further upgrades
          to happen so that these issues can be minimised and cause less issues for Chadstone
          and their shoppers.
        </div>

        <h4>Description</h4>
        <div class="project">
          The app that will be developed will be called Chadstone Parking, and will be programmed
          through MIT app inventor, which allows for everyone to have the ability to create and build
          apps. It is quick and very easy to use because there is no typing for the code, therefore
          you are just dropping and select the code you want (About Us, 2022). The app will connect
          to the sensors that are already above the car spots in Chadstone Shopping Centre (Chadstone
          Shopping Centre selects Frogparking to deliver parking guidance technology – Frogparking, 2022).
          The connection between the two will be made through a Zigbee and Z-waven hubs (Colwill, 2022),
          this means that it will not need an internet connection to function. This permits the connection
          to made between the app and the sensors even if there is internet connection or mobile data connection,
          allowing users to find available car parks and return to their vehicle. Chadstone’s map of the parking
          lot and the layers of them will also be visible and interactive (Car Parking at Chadstone - The Fashion
          Capital, 2022). An added feature of the app will be the ability to enter the gate/road you go in to, so
          that the individual can manage their way and find the parking spot they want, without any signal.
          Additionally, it will include the potential to advise the user the type of parking the spaces are,
          for example, a 90 mins parking zone, family parking, stroller parking zone, etc. The utilisation of the
          user’s location will operate either through their mobile data, internet connection and/or GPS. (How Do
          Smartphones and Applications Know Your Location?, 2022). By doing so, this will allow the app to access
          the individual’s location (if they accept) and help navigate them to free cark parks. it will help those
          find their cars when deciding they are finished with shopping. Some drawbacks from the development of this
          app could be that although there is the ability to operate it without a WIFI or mobile connection, by
          using an alternative means the app is not going to function at its true potential. Further, if there is
          an accident or an issue within a certain area of the parking, the app doesn’t have the capability to make
          users aware. An obstacle that could be faced is not having the ability to connect the all the sensors to the app,
          as some will be located underground. This makes it more difficult to find a method to connect the two.

        <h4>Skills & Tech</h4>

        <div class="project">
          The software needed to make this app possible is MIT app inventor, as this is what
          will program the app. Therefore, prior knowledge and skill in using this would make
          it easier and more time efficient to get things done however it would not be needed.
          The inventor has several tutorials and guides to assist beginners. Additionally, making
          sure that the information of the persons location is staying private means extra
          security measures must be taken.
        </div>

        <h4>Outcome</h4>

        <div class="project">
          To conclude my project idea, by changing the parking system for Chadstone through an
          app to assist with finding parking and finding your vehicle when leaving the centre,
          will be an efficient and timely change. Not only that it will further decrease the
          amount of traffic and accidents that happen within Chadstone’s parking areas. By
          successfully achieving this project, it will help me gain experience in assisting others
          in a more practical manner whilst being able to produce something that is commercially viable.
