          I come from a diverse family, my mum being from the Philippines
          and my dad from Germany, however I can only speak English.

          I graduated highschool in 2021 at Keysborough College and hope to graduate
          from University with a Bachelor of Information Technology before the year 2026;
          Then hopefully complete further studies and do a graduates program.
          RMIT is the second Uni i have attended as I use to be enrolled at Monash
          and did my first semester there for Bachelor of IT and Business.

      <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
      <p>
        I own 2 cats named tika and lila!
        Theyre are so incredibly annoying and clingy & they have detroyed my couch.

      <p>
        I also enjoy playing sports but tend to not have time to anymore
        because of work and uni. Although when I do I usually play social volleyball
        and soccer here and there.

      <p>
        If I could eat one food for the rest of my life itâ€™ll probably be potato
        bake or spaghetti.
