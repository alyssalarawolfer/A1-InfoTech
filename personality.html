      <div class="test-1">
        Through the results of all the quizzes, I learnt more about myself than
        I was expecting. It displays my strengths and weakness in a range of settings,
        which aids with my future careers. According to the 16 Personality Test a
        “Protagonist” stating that although they love helping and pushing their friends,
        they aren’t always happy with the result (Friendships | Protagonist (ENFJ)
        Personality | 16Personalities, 2022). Through this, I have learnt that I must
        be more accepting of other’s choices even if it is something I do not want.
        So in terms of group settings, releasing that if others believe that my ideas
        are not suitable or achievable for what we are trying to accomplish, I should
        not take it to heart.

        Also stating that these people want to help their co-workers be
        successful and achieve their goals (Workplace Habits | Protagonist (ENFJ) Personality
        | 16Personalities, 2022). This helps for when I work in team projects as I try to make
        sure we achieve everyone’s goals whilst achieving our main objective as a group. Similarly
        in the Big Five Personality Test, it states that people with a higher percentage of “Agreeableness”
        tend to work together with their team, rather than compete (The Big Five Personality Test, 2022).

        This displays that I would work effectively in teams, and because I enjoy and stive to help
        others, this could suggest I could make a great leader in a team. Lastly my results on my
        Learning Style Test helped me become aware that I am a “Auditory” learner (What's Your Learning Style?
        20 Questions, 2022). Through this I was able to realise that since I work more efficiently when music
        or noises are in the background, I must make it aware that I am still listening to my peers and team members.
        Also letting them know that I would rather have zoom calls and meet in person to work on tasks rather than just
        texting
