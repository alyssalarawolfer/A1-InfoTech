      <h1>Personality</h1>

      <div class="tests">
        Through the results of all the quizzes, I learnt more about myself than
        I was expecting. It displays my strengths and weakness in a range of settings,
        which aids with my future careers. According to the 16 Personality Test a “Protagonist”
        stating that although they love helping and pushing their friends, they aren’t always
        happy with the result (Friendships | Protagonist (ENFJ) Personality | 16Personalities, 2022).
        Through this, I have learnt that I must be more accepting of other’s choices even if it is
        something I do not want. So in terms of group settings, releasing that if others believe
        that my ideas are not suitable or achievable for what we are trying to accomplish,
        I should not take it to heart. Also stating that these people want to help their co-workers
        be successful and achieve their goals (Workplace Habits | Protagonist (ENFJ) Personality |
        16Personalities, 2022). This helps for when I work in team projects as I try to make sure
        we achieve everyone’s goals whilst achieving our main objective as a group.
