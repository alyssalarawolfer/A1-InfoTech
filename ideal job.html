      <h1>Ideal Job</h1>

      <p>
        A dream job of mine is to be a Software Engineer for a company I grew up around,
        an example is this Pixarâ€™s advertisement for a Software Engineer, Characters & Crowds.
        In this role they are looking for engineers that are willing to participate in self-individual projects
        or working with a range of technical groups to utilize their skills to work around their digital actors.
      </p>

      <p>
        What intrigues me about this job advertisement, was that Pixar was an animation production that I grew up
        watching movies from and always loved. So being able to have the opportunity to work at the company I grew
        up with would be more than amazing. Additionally, as I mentioned in my ideal job, I am fascinated in a career
        that will allow me to express my creativity and ideas, and with this occupation it will be able to do so in an team environment.
