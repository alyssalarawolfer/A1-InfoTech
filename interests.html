      <h2> My Interest for It </h2>

      <div class="interests">
        At young age I fell in love with playing games on a variety of consoles,
        like the PlayStation, PCs, and the Nintendo DSI. I remember playing games such as Team
        Fortress, Buzz! Junior Jungle Party, Super Mario, and others. Then as technology grew and
        evolved, I was gifted my first phone, an iPhone 4.
        It was only meant for calls and messages;
        however, I downloaded a large number of games and music apps that I still use to currently.
        Through this I became very curious in how games were made, what people used to make them and
        the overall creative process.

      <h2>Why It?</h2>
      <div class="interests">
        In no way did I believe I was someone who could pursue IT as a future job because of how male dominated
        the industry and how intimidating and difficult it seemed to learn to code. Further, I imagined a career
        in IT would involve me sitting by myself in a small room for 9-10 hours; with no room for creativity and
        teamwork.

      <div class="interests">
        Nevertheless, as I researched more into the jobs, I saw there were heaps in the industry that
        allowed me to express my creativity and allowed me to interact with the client, work colleagues and/or
        work alone. A Web Developer and Software Engineer are two careers that aim to have at the end of my degrees
        and grow towards, as they both involve room to creativity and offer to work in groups.

      <h2>Why RMIT?</h2>
      <div class="interests">
        At the beginning of 2022 I undertook a Bachelor of Information Technology and Business at Monash, I was able
        to gain some experience in Java and Object-Oriented Programming, Binary numbers, Networks and Cybersecurity.
        Although Monash was a great learning environment, I was experiencing a lot of personal and family issues that
        led to more difficult circumstances because of Monashâ€™s lack of support. Therefore, I decided to discontinue my
        course from Monash and try a different Uni.  I choose to apply at RMIT as it was my second preference on my VTAC
        course preference list, also, I admired the units and the learning content. At the end of my degree, I expect to
        have the basic skills to start a my own project and/or join a company, whilst continuing to learn and grow throughout
        my career and maybe become a software engineer .
